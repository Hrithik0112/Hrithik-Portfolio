          I am particularly inclined toward building products that blend technical excellence with great design. I am always exploring new technologiesâ€”currently focusing on advanced animations, state management, and performance optimization in React Native and Expo. My commitment to continuous learning drives me to stay updated with industry trends and best practices.
